I am building a real-time chat application as part of learning React and GCP Services like Firestore database, Cloud Run, and App Engine.

Project Description:

1. Firebase Authentication: The chat application will use Firebase Authentication to provide secure and user-friendly registration and login features. 

2. Firestore Database: Firestore is a NoSQL cloud database provided by Firebase. It is ideal for real-time data synchronization and offers a flexible and scalable database structure. 

3. Open API Integration (still working on it): To generate usernames and user profile pictures, integrate an Open API that provides random or customizable user data. These APIs can offer creative and dynamic usernames and profile pictures to make the chat experience more engaging and personalized. Popular options include the RandomUser.me API or the Adorable Avatars API.

4. React Frontend: The front end of the chat application is built using React.

5. Hosting with Google Cloud Run: Google Cloud Run is a serverless platform that allows you to easily deploy and manage containerized applications. (Later I opted for Vercel since gcp credits are getting less).
